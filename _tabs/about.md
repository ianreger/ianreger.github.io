### About Me
I am Ian Reger, others call me Worm, Regular, E, E-In, or whatever they really desire. I am from the Springfield, PA. A small suburban town outside of Philadelphia. I graduated from Millersville University with a degree in Computer Science in 2021. I work professionally in the IT field, specializing in system administration, networking, and scripting. I am proficient in Python, Java, Docker, and Virutalization.
My outdoor hobbies consist of skateboarding, rock climbing, and hiking. After work I usually destress by stressing myself out over video games and my homelab.
